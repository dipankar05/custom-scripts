## General description

Canopy cover quantifies the percentage of area occupied by trees within a
pixel, where a tree is defined as vegetation 5 meters or taller. This metric will be most sensitive to tree clearing
events like timber harvest or deforestation, but is also sensitive to seasonal leaf-on variation and to drought.

The data layer has four bands:

- **Canopy Cover** quantifies the horizontal area occupied by tree canopies that are > 5m tall.
- **Lower prediction bound (5th percentile)** of the 90% prediction interval for model predictions at each pixel.
- **Upper prediction bound (95th percentile)** of the 90% prediction interval for model predictions at each pixel.
- **Quality Assurance Flags** describing the expected quality of satellite data measurements, and
  whether any temporal gap-filling was applied.
