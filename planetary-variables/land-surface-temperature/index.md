# Land Surface Temperature

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the thermodynamic temperature of Earthâ€™s surface. LST is a key variable controlling energy, and water fluxes over the land surface and atmosphere interface. In view of increasing extreme temperature events and a growing population exposed to these events, LST is increasingly relevant to sustainably manage food and water systems and urban living conditions.

Planet's LST product provides near real-time measurements twice a day at 1:30 and 13:30 solar local time and at spatial resolutions of 100 m and 1000 m. It is unhindered by clouds and has a long and consistent data record of more than 20 years.
